# Passion & Interests 

My life is defined by exploration, creativity, and personal growth. My greatest passion is music. I am primarily a singer but also enjoy playing the acoustic guitar. Whether performing as the lead in my high school musical, singing in the a cappella group “The Ransom Notes” at the University of Texas, or playing in bands around Austin, music has always been a meaningful outlet for me outside of my professional life.

I also love travel and adventure. During my undergraduate years, I studied abroad in the Czech Republic and backpacked through Eastern Europe, visiting countries like Croatia, Austria, Germany, and Hungary. These experiences not only broadened my perspective but also reinforced my love for exploring new cultures. This passion extends to my love for hiking and long road trips, often accompanied by my dog, Nina. Growing up, I recall RV trips with my grandparents and cousins, fostering a deep appreciation for the outdoors and family road trips.
Fitness is another cornerstone of my life. I enjoy weightlifting, playing basketball, and have completed several marathons and half-marathons. One of my proudest achievements was being the fastest male freshman at the inaugural Longhorn Run at UT Austin. I find that staying active is essential not only for my physical health but also for maintaining balance and focus in all aspects of my life.

In my professional role with Pulte Group, I am enthusiastic about exploring different master-planned communities in the Austin area. I love seeing these communities at various stages of the land development process, and ultimately seeing a project come to life.

Finally, philanthropy is extremely important to me as a lifelong pursuit. During my undergraduate education, I helped raise $25,000 for Easter Seals of Central Texas to support therapy for disabled children. I also obtained 12 sponsorships and raised $1,600 at an event benefiting the Texas Blind and Visually Impaired.

Overall, my goal in life is to live fully, step outside of my comfort zone, and continually challenge myself.

# Bio

Born in Victoria, Texas, I was raised in a family that valued hard work and dedication. My father, a Navy veteran and mechanical engineer at DuPont, and my mother, a school counselor, instilled in me a strong work ethic from an early age. As an only child, I spent my early years in Victoria before moving to North Carolina in middle school and then settling in Clear Lake City, Texas, where I attended Clear Lake High School near NASA.

I’ve always had a passion for music and was the lead in my high school’s senior musical, Bye Bye Birdie, and continued to pursue music as a hobby throughout my life.
I attended the University of Texas at Austin, where I graduated in 2013 with a Bachelor of Business Administration in Finance. During my time at UT, I balanced a rigorous academic schedule with my love for music, singing in an a cappella group called The Ransom Notes and performing in bands around the Austin area.

Leaning on my work ethic and dedication, I earned a 4.0 GPA after my freshman year and was admitted to the Business Honors Program at the McCombs School of Business.
Ultimately, I graduated with a degree in Business Honors/ Finance and focused my professional pursuits on the real estate industry.

After graduation, I began my career in private equity real estate in Austin, specializing in asset management. My work experience included overseeing student and workforce housing portfolios and working across the entire investment lifecycle, from development to rehabilitation. At Amherst Holdings, I focused on the single-family residential sector, sourcing and acquiring land for build-to-rent projects. This experience sparked my interest in land development and led me to pursue a Master of Land and Property Development at Texas A&M University.

Throughout my career, I have developed a passion for creating sustainable residential communities that allow future generations to build families and live their dreams. I hope to use my education and experience to address the critical need for affordable housing, revitalizing the country’s aging inventory and developing new units that promote safety, affordability, and growth for the future.

### Strategic Vision and Execution

My role at Amherst Holdings exemplified my ability to develop and implement comprehensive business plans. I managed the renovation and sale of over 1,000 residential homes, which required a strategic vision and consistent execution. This experience helped hone my skills in assessing market trends, negotiating deals, and identifying profitable real estate investment opportunities.

### Cross-Functional Team Leadership
At Campus Advantage, I led a team through every phase of the investment cycle for approximately 50 student housing properties. My responsibilities included overseeing institutional reporting, capital projects, and strategic decision-making, showcasing my ability to manage complex projects and collaborate effectively with various stakeholders.

### Analytical and Financial Expertise
My role at Virtus Real Estate involved financial modeling, preparing comprehensive reports, and contributing to successful asset dispositions totaling over $450 million. These experiences have enabled me to evaluate land opportunities and make informed decisions that align with strategic objectives.

### Innovative Problem-Solving
My involvement in developing a technology-based retail platform at Amherst Holdings required innovative thinking and adaptability. I effectively sourced design/build companies and managed high-end residential projects, demonstrating my problem-solving and creative skills.

### Commitment to Sustainable Development
Currently, as a Land Acquisition Manager at Pulte Group, I am involved in exploring master-planned communities and understanding various stages of land development. This role has reinforced my commitment to creating sustainable, eco-friendly communities that align with future growth and environmental stewardship.
I plan to build on these leadership qualities as I embark on a new career path in the homebuilding industry with Pulte Group. I am dedicated to leveraging my skillsets to contribute to successful and sustainable land development projects.

### Howdy!

With a decade of experience in real estate, I have developed a deep appreciation for creating affordable and safe housing for working-class families. Growing up in a family that valued hard work and homebuilding, I carried these principles into my academic journey at the University of Texas at Austin, where I excelled academically and discovered my passion for real estate.

My professional experience has spanned asset management, development, and community building, working with diverse stakeholders to revitalize and develop housing solutions. Inspired by my work at Amherst Holdings, I am now pursuing the Master in Land & Property Development at Texas A&M to gain the skills needed to make a meaningful impact on the nation's housing challenges.

I am eager to leverage my experience and education to help ensure sustainable housing for future generations

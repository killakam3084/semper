I attended Clear Lake High School in Clear Lake City, Texas, a suburb southeast of the Houston Metro. 

Upon graduating in May 2009, I moved to Austin, Texas to attend the University of Texas. I was admitted into the McCombs School of Business my sophomore year and graduated with a degree in Business Honors/ Finance in December 2013. 

I decided to obtain my real estate license and took courses through Champions School of Real Estate in Spring of 2023. 

After obtaining my license through TREC (Texas Real Estate Commission) in June 2023, I moved to College Station, Texas for the Master of Land and Property Development Program. 

I will officially complete this program in December 2024 and graduate from Texas A&M with a Masterâ€™s Degree in Land and Property Development.
